This project explores a multimodal deep learning approach to predict ADHD outcomes using both fMRI connectivity matrices and behavioral/demographic features. We implement a dual-path architecture combining BrainNetCNN for graph-based fMRI inputs and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for high-dimensional behavioral data, followed by fusion and classification. To handle class imbalance and enhance generalization, techniques such as SMOTE, weighted sampling, and early stopping were employed. Grid search with cross-validation identified the best model configuration. Our best-performing model achieved a cross-validated F1 score of 0.89 and demonstrated reasonable performance on a held-out validation set.
